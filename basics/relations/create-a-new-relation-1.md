# Create a New Relation

The [anytype-library](../anytype-library/ "mention") is the central place to manage, search for, and create new relations.

### Creating Relations from All Objects

Open the [anytype-library](../anytype-library/ "mention") widget, and navigate to the Relations tab. Afterwards, simply click on `New` button to create a new Relation.

From here, you can choose a name and a type for your new Relation.

If you've decided that this Relation is no longer relevant, you can use the context menu (mouse right-click) to delete the Relation from your space.

### Creating Relations from the Object Editor

To create new relations on-the-fly, you can follow the instructions from[#adding-and-managing-relations](create-a-new-relation.md#adding-and-managing-relations "mention"), and use the relation selection menu in the same way as the search bar in the Relation library. The relation will be automatically added to your Relations library, while you can proceed with editing the current object.

Any relation you create from the object editor will be available for editing in the Relations library using the steps above.
