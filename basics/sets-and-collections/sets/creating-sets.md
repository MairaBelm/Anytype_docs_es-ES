# Creating Sets

### You can create a Set with the + in the bottom-left corner or using the / shortcut menu in the editor.

You'll then need to choose if you want a Set by Type which lets you list all of your Objects of a certain Type, or a Set by Relation which will list all Objects that contain the Relation of your choosing.&#x20;

You can also create a Set by Type from the Object type toggle on a new document.

### Next, you need to decide on the purpose of your Set.&#x20;

For example, project management may require Type: Project, for reading list â€” Book. From the Library, choose an Object Type, click "Create," and choose "Create a set."

This will then create a set of all the Objects with the Type: Books.&#x20;

Now you have an organized selection of all your book objects entered into Anytype.
