# Space

A **Space** is a container for your graph of objects.

Youâ€™re able to create multiple separate spaces (up to 10), each with their own graph of objects, widget sidebar, and later on - privacy settings. You can have up to 3 shared spaces depending on your [membership](../memberships-and-pricing/monetization/) plan.

Simply click your profile picture to create new spaces, or navigate between existing ones.

Use the [space management menu](../intro/setting-up-your-profile/space-settings.md) at the top of your sidebar to customize your space settings or delete your space.

You can also manage all of your spaces by going into `Settings > Vault & Key > Spaces`.
