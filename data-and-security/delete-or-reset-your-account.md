# Data Erasure

Since we don't have access to your Anytype data, and we have no way to connect your Anytype ID to your email address, there is no way for us to delete your data. This means that you will need to delete it yourself through the app.

### Delete or Reset Your Account

In the top menu, Click "Anytype", open Settings, Data management, and select **Delete account.** This will delete your profile, and your Recovery Phrase:

If you would like to start a new account instead, do the following:

1. Anytype>Settings>Account>Data management>Delete account
2. Anytype>Settings>Account >Log Out
3. Click: “_**Join**_” (instead of "Log in")

### Other Data

For everything else (forum posts, support tickets, and email subscriptions), please contact us at [support@anytype.io](mailto:support@anytype.io), and we'll delete these for you.
